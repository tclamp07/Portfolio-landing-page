    Hi there, my name is Tony Clampitt and this page will provide a brief description of who I am and what brought me here.  I decided to start my journey at epicodus at the tail end of my previous career as a sales director for a company called Grow Generation.  While working at Grow Generation I was responsible for anything and everything as far as sales are concerned.  This position demanded a very large chunk of my time and prevented me from learning new things and most importantly, allowed me no flexibility in scheduling.  After realizing this was not the path I wanted to take I decided to pursue a career in coding/software develeopment in hopes to attain a position with more flexibility/freedom.  Specifically, allowing me to either work abroad and/or have flexibility in my schedule.  After some research it seemed that epicous would be the perfect fit for me and my schedule.  Im looking forward to continuing my journey at epicodus learning the skills necessary in reaching my career goals.
